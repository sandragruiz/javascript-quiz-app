//Pseudocode

// criteria: when I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question//

    // Establish questions
    //1. Commonly used data types do NOT include:
        //strings
        //booleans
        //alerts
        //numbers
    //2. The condition in an if/else statement is enclosed with:
        //quotes
        //curly brackets
        //parenthesis
        //square brackets
    //3. Arrays in JavaScript can be used to store:
        //numbers and strings
        //other arrays
        //booleans
        //all of the above
    //4. String values must be enclosed within ____ when being assigned to variables.
        //commas
        //curly brackets 
        //quotes
        //parenthesis
    //5. A very useful tool used during development and debugging for printing content to the debugger is:
        //JavaScript
        //terminal/bash
        //for loops
        //console log

    //set timer function
    //set events for clicking the start button (starts the countdown and presents the first question)

// criteria: when I answer a question, then I am presented with another question//

    //set event for clicking an answer button that leads to next question

// criteria: when I answer incorrectly, time (10 sec) is subtracted from the timer //

    // establish which answers are correct and incorrect
    // when clicking on incorrect answer, time must be reduced by 10 seconds

// when all questions are answered or timer reaches 0, the game is over
    
    //set event for when timer ends or finish questions, the end screen appears
    //end screen is currently under class quiz-end

// when game is over, I can save my initials and score
